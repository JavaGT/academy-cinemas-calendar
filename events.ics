DESCRIPTION:Mister Organ\n2022 Rated M\nJournalist and filmmaker David Farr
	ier (Tickled\, Dark Tourist) becomes fascinated by the late-night antics o
	f a rogue wheel clamper in New Zealand. When Jillian Bashford\, the owner 
	of the shop this wheel clamper patrols\, denies knowing him\, Farrier beco
	mes even more intrigued by the mysterious figure. The clamper is Michael O

	 finding he's actually a convicted thief who once claimed to be royalty. A
	t this point\, Farrier finds Organ has set his sights on him\, too — with 
	him and the antique store owner\, Bashford\, filing legal papers against h
	im. As Farrier attempts to decipher what is going on with Organ and Bashfo
	rd\, he meets other victims who Michael moved in on in the past. Farrier t
	hen attends court with Organ and loses. Afterward\, he sits down with this
	 strange figure to talk about what the hell is going on\, surprised when B
	ashford turns up too\, seemingly happy and jovial. At this point\, Organ p
	ushes further into filmmaker Farrier's life\, revealing that he has a key 
	to Farrier's house. Instead of pulling away\, Farrier becomes more curious
	\, spending more and more time with Organ. Organ tells Farrier that other 
	mystery men are responsible for all the problems he encountered — like ste

	 only is Organ a master manipulator\, but he also inserts himself psycholo
	gically into people's minds\; and that he is inserting himself into Farrie
