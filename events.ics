	<br /><br />PIRANHA (1978)<br />95 mins<br />Director: Joe Dante<br /><br 
	/>Man has meddled again with mother nature and the result is not only dead
	ly...it's voracious! With a clever screenplay written by John Sayles (APOL
	LO 13) from a story by Richard Robinson\, director Joe Dante (GREMLINS) cr
	eates an eerie and devilishly fun tale of mutant piranha terrorizing a loc
	al swimming hole. <br /><br />On an inviting tranquil evening\, two ventur
	esome teenagers take a moonlit skinny-dip in the inviting waters of Lost R
	iver Lake...little did they know they would quickly become fish food for a
	 hungry school of man-eating piranha! Their deaths prompt an investigation
	 that reveals a governmental cover-up of a top secret experiment called Op
	eration Razorteeth. And it only gets worse. These insatiable\, gilled mons
	ters are heading downstream where a newly opened swimming resort will give
	 them a smorgasbord of tasty vacationers\, unless a brave outdoorsman (Bra
	dford Dillman) and a sharp\, beautiful investigator (Heather Menzies) can 
	stop their deadly spawn...for good.<br /><br /><br />HUMANOIDS FROM THE DE
	EP aka: MONSTER (1980)<br />80 mins<br />Director: Barbara Peeters<br /><b
	r />Noyo's a sleepy little place\, where nothing much happens. So why are 
	people being attacked and killed by THINGS that come out of the water? The
	 answer involves pollution and mutated sea life that's developed a taste f
	or death. As the 'orrible humanoids lay siege to Noyo\, it's up to the gre
	at Doug McClure (THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT\; WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS)\, to pu
	t a stop to their murderous rampages.<br /><br />Notorious for all the sex
	 'n' violence that producer Roger Corman insisted on adding against the di
	rector's wishes\, HUMANOIDS OF THE DEEP is a monster movie for the Video N
	asty age.\nhttps://ticketing.oz.veezi.com/purchase/30393?siteToken&#x3D\;v
