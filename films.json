With a clever screenplay written by John Sayles (APOLLO 13) from a story by Richard Robinson, director Joe Dante (GREMLINS) creates an eerie and devilishly fun tale of mutant piranha terrorizing a local swimming hole. <br /><br />On an inviting tranquil evening, two venturesome teenagers take a moonlit skinny-dip in the inviting waters of Lost River Lake...little did they know they would quickly become fish food for a hungry school of man-eating piranha! Their deaths prompt an investigation that reveals a governmental cover-up of a top secret experiment called Operation Razorteeth. And it only gets worse. These insatiable, gilled monsters are heading downstream where a newly opened swimming resort will give them a smorgasbord of tasty vacationers, unless a brave outdoorsman (Bradford Dillman) and a sharp, beautiful investigator (Heather Menzies) can stop their deadly spawn...for good.<br /><br /><br />HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP aka: MONSTER (1980)<br />80 mins<br />Director: Barbara Peeters<br /><br />Noyo's a sleepy little place, where nothing much happens. So why are people being attacked and killed by THINGS that come out of the water? The answer involves pollution and mutated sea life that's developed a taste for death. As the 'orrible humanoids lay siege to Noyo, it's up to the great Doug McClure (THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT; WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS), to put a stop to their murderous rampages.<br /><br />Notorious for all the sex 'n' violence that producer Roger Corman insisted on adding against the director's wishes, HUMANOIDS OF THE DEEP is a monster movie for the Video Nasty age.",
